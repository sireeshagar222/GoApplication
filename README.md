GoApplication assignment 


Assignment Overview : 

Create a simple Go application that prints "Hello from Botgauge" at the /hello path. Develop
and configure a GitHub Actions pipeline to build the application, containerize it, and push it
to a container registry. Use Terraform to create an EKS cluster with necessary add-ons.
Finally, create a pipeline to deploy the application to the EKS cluster using Helm or
Kustomize.
